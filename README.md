# CSS_BoxModel_Project
# Chapter 2 of CSS_in_depth by Keith j. Grant
This webpage is based on practicing the CSS box model, and how several techniques can be use to achieve uniformity eg like this CSS selector 
body * + * { 
  margin-top: 1.5em;
}
 which pickering calls the lobotomized owl effect. Used to create a more generalized solution.
